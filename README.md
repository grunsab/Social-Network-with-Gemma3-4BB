## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repo-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.


## Database

The application uses SQLite by default (`social_network.db`). The database schema is created automatically when `app.py` is first run.

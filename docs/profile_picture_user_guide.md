# Profile Picture Upload Feature

This feature allows users to upload and manage their profile pictures, which will be displayed throughout the social network application.

## User Guide

### Uploading a Profile Picture

1. Navigate to your profile page by clicking on "My Profile" in the navigation menu
2. You'll see a circular profile picture placeholder with a button below it labeled "Add Photo" (or "Change Photo" if you already have a profile picture)
3. Click this button to open a file selection dialog
4. Select an image file from your device (.jpg, .png, etc.)
5. The image will automatically upload and display as your profile picture

### Requirements and Limitations

- **File Types**: Only image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) are accepted
- **File Size**: Maximum file size is 5MB

### Where Profile Pictures Appear

Your profile picture will appear in several places throughout the application:

- In comments you leave on posts
- In friend lists and friend requests
- In the navigation bar (if applicable)

## Technical Details

### Storage

Profile pictures are stored in the cloud using the application's configured storage solution (S3 or similar). The URL of the image is stored in the user's profile database record.

### Security

- File uploads are validated on both the client and server sides
- Only authenticated users can upload profile pictures
- Files are scanned for malware (if configured)
- Private storage buckets prevent unauthorized access to raw files

### Privacy

Your profile picture visibility follows the same rules as your profile:
- Public profiles: Profile picture visible to all users
- Private profiles: Profile picture visible only to friends (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Errors

If you encounter errors while uploading your profile picture:

1. Ensure the file is a valid image format
2. Check that the file size is under 5MB
3. Try a different browser or device
4. If the issue persists, contact support

### Display Issues

If your profile picture doesn't display correctly:

1. Try refreshing the page
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try uploading a different image
4. Check your internet connection

## Future Plans

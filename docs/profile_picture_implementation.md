# Profile Picture Upload Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the profile picture upload feature.

## Components Changed

1. **Backend**:
   - Added `/api/v1/profiles/upload_picture` endpoint in app.py
   - Updated profile_patch_parser in profile.py to accept profile_picture field
   - Ensured the upload endpoint correctly saves to S3 and updates the user model

2. **Frontend**:
   - Added file input, state management, and upload logic to Profile.jsx
   - Created ProfileImages.css for styling profile pictures across the application
   - Updated Post.jsx to properly display profile pictures in posts and comments
   - Added refreshUserProfile function to AuthContext for global profile updates

## Testing

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Added test_profile_picture_upload.py script for manual testing
   - Created test profile images in the cypress/fixtures directory

2. **Cypress Testing**:
   - Added default-profile.png fallback image
   - Test that profile pictures display correctly in all relevant components

## How It Works

1. User clicks the "Add Photo" or "Change Photo" button on their profile
2. File input opens, and user selects an image file
3. Frontend validates the file type and size
4. File is uploaded to the backend via FormData
5. Backend uploads the file to S3 and gets a URL
6. User model is updated with the profile picture URL
7. Frontend refreshes the profile data, including the AuthContext
8. Profile picture displays in all components that use it

## Future Improvements

1. Add ability to remove profile picture
2. Add image cropping before upload
3. Add client-side image compression to reduce upload size
4. Add server-side image optimization and resizing
5. Add content moderation for profile pictures
